# Marvel Fight Night

The concept of a dating app was not appealing to me. I turned the projec tinto somehting very simialr to a dating app but with a slight twist. I used teh cam concept about compatability. You would rank something on various properties in varying scales. From tehre you could preform some checks for close matches. 

In this example you are supposed to be a super powered person who has lost one too many fights. You need a win so you come to our app to help pick an opponenet that you match up with. You cna enter in your stats base don the Marvel Comic Power rankings. I added another category. Noramlly the scale is from 1-7 with 1 being the worst and 7 being the best. y added category actually works in reverse where 1 in best and 7 is the worst. This foreced me to hadle rankingisn for the "Gadget Reliance" category differenlty. 

In addition I also allow a hero to fight a hero or a viallian to fight a villian.
